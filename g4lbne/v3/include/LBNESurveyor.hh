/*
** This class, and it's subclasses (SurveyedPt), is an attempt at describing the 
** the process of surveying the LBNE target and neutrino beam elements. 
** It is not mean to be a general tool: Qunatities are specific to the LBNE beam layout. 
**
** The main class is a singleton. It can be refered by the LBNESubVolume class, when it comes to place 
** a sub volume. Unlike the SubVolume class, this class does not actively place volume in the hierarchy. 
** It simply manages the key surveyed points along the beam line. 
** 
** It is expected to be interface to a LBNESurveyorMessenger, derived class from G4Messenger class 
** to set things up.
**
** The constructor of this class (private, as it is a singleton class) simply sets all position to 
** (0. 0. 0.) and tolerance to a rediculously small number (i.e., by default things are perfectly aligned.) 
**
** Intended use: This would be a two step process:
**
**   1.  Prior to instantiatiated the G4 geometry, the container class LBNESurveyor is instantiated. 
**  Surveyed Points are added, one by one, by name.  This could be done in the LBNESurveyor contructor, 
** or else where in this package, provided that the G4Placement are not yet done. The goal is to 
** provide a survey "log book" 
**
**  2. Based on the above logbook, as one construct the G4 geometry, one enquire about the relative coordinates
** of the surveyed points, relative to the nominal base line. From this points, a rotation matrix and vector displacement 
** for the relevant volume can be computed, either in the  LBNESubVolume constructor, or any of the G4 geometry
** construction process, where the G4Placement occured. 
**
** Example: when it is time to place the Horn1 outer conductor (or a volume firmly attached to it) into 
** Horn1 hall (or a smaller box that fully contains it), one does 
**
** G4ThreeVector nominalPlacement (0., -5., -3471.);  // Where the z coordinate is either hardtyped, or obtained 
** from the subclass G4SubVolume. We have been told that a vertical offset of 5 mm is "really there.." 
** These are the nominal coordinates. They could be set by the messenger of the LBNESubvolume class, 
** if need be. 
**
** LBNESurveyor* mySurveyor = LBNESurveyor::GetInstance();
** std::vector<LBNESurveyedPt>::const_iterator itPinUpstream=mySurveyor->GetPoint("Horn1/UpstreamLeftPin");
** G4ThreeVector pinUpsL =  itPinUpstream->GetPosition();
** G4ThreeVector pinUpsR =  mySurveyor->GetPoint("Horn1/UpstreamRightPin")->GetPosition();
**
** ... Assume for now the downstream pin is perfectly aligned 
** deduce an overall placement:
** 
** G4ThreeVector honr1OuterPos = nominalPlacement + 0.5*(pinUpsL + pinUpsR);
** aHorn1OuterPhysical = new G4PVPlacement(0, honr1OuterPos,...) 
**
** Unlike LBNESubVolume class, the LBNESurveyor class has knowledge about the complete survey of the beam 
** line, and therefore can check relative alignment prior to the geometry construction. It could also contain
** surveyed point (monuments) that would have no correspondance to a corner, or a center,  of the G4Volume.
