Repository for LBNE-specific code.

g4lbne includes all of the iterations of LBNE's g4lbne software I'm working on (the version 3
prototyping and the version 2 patching (ugh)).

GasCherenkov is a stand-alone Geant4 simulation simulating muons in a pipe of
variable pressure, and measuring the cerenkov light (a possible scheme for
monitoring the muons from the neutrino beam).
